# Tile Game and Solver

A Platform and Solver for ordering NxN tiles into the correct order

In 2001, I took a Scheme based class where one of the final projects
was to write a program to visualize and solve a 4x4 tile game.  I
wrote up a solution for the class, but the AI had no planning ability.
It was a very heuristic heavy solution, and I always wanted to improve
on it.  Recently I decided to learn Clojure and thought this would be
a nice project to dig my teeth into.
